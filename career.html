              <h1>Anesthesiology, What and Why?</h1>
              <p>What is an Anesthesiologist? An Anesthesiologist is someone who does anesthesia during surgery. However, one must be very precise and careful while doing this job as one tiny mistake could lead to either someone waking up during surgery if given too little or just dying if given too much. You must be good at quick calculations in your brain to do this job because you need to firgure out how much to give someone based on their height, bodyweight, bodyfat, blood pressure, and many other factors.</p>
              <p>Why Anesthesiology? There are two main reason behind my choice of Anesthesiology. One is that ever since I've been young, I've wanted to be a doctor of some sort and help people. Now, how could I do this while still making a very high paycheck? Anesthesiology is the answer. On average the starting salary is around $400,000 which is just ridiculous.</p>

              <h1>University #1, Johns Hopkins University</h1>
              <p>One of if not the best medical universities in the USA, Johns Hopkins boasts a very high student excellence rate and has smaller class sizes, allowing professors to individually help students like how they do in Highchool/Middleschool. Not only this, but a wellknown Ivy League Medical college would be perfect for a medical professional.</p>

              <h1>University #2, Harvard University</h1>
              <p>Of course, Harvard University. Who wouldn't want to go here? Not only is it an Ivy, but despite being very broad it still boasts a great medical program. While not as advanced as Johns Hopkins, Harvard is still very selective which means you will only be surrounding youself with people of greater intellect, allowing you to constantly challege yourself to reach the top, standing out to potential employers.</p>
