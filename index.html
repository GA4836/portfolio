        <h1>Dolma Recipe</h1>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Dolma is an ancient food, it goes as far back as the Ancient Assyrian Period (934BC-609BC). It can have a large variety of ways to make it, with the main one being inside of grape leaves (which is what my recipe will be about).</p>
        <p>It contains a mix of rice, spices, herbs, tomatoes, and more.</p>
        <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>

                    <li>Might have to purchase at a local store</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>8 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>2 spoons of salt</li>
            <li>1 spoon of black pepper</li>
            <li>2 spoons of citric acid</li>
            <li>1/2 spoon of red pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup of water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><i>Directions</i></h3>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil your grape leaves for 2 minutes and let them dry in a strainer.</li>
            <li>Cut the tomatoes, scallions, garlic, and parsley into very small pieces.</li>
            <li>Mix the chopped items with your tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Add in your seasonings and mix.</li>
            <li>Mix in your olive oil.</li>
            <li>Wash your rice and strain it and then mix it with the mixture.</li>
            <li>Clear a large space and prepare a large pot, your grape leaves, and your mixture.</li>
            <li>Place one grape leaf on the table, then place mixture inside of it closing it similar to a burrito and put it inside of your pot. Repeat this until you have either no grape leaves or no mixture.</li>
            <li>Place your pot on the stove and put a plate on top of your uncooked dolma, pour water until you see it just about touching the plate.</li>
            <li>Turn your stove on high for 20 minutes and after this place it on low for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the stove and let it cool.</li>
